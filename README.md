# Reviews

Makers reviews are live coding challenges in front of an external evaluator. The evaluator will act as a client with a set of reqiurements and it is your job to interpret those requirements and ask questions in order to build a program that delivers the objective. This includes asking about edge cases and meeting the client's needs here too.

Test Driven Development is used to get to the result.

This is a log of my five reviews from Makers and the corresponding score cards. Reviews can last up to an hour with actual coding time ranging from 20 - 45 minutes.

The code in each review is far from perfect or even complete. The reviews are about process, not writing perfect code.
